# Maintainers & Authors (mcxForge)

## Current Maintainer

- **Aleksi Ursin** – Lead architect and primary maintainer  
  - Company: Magna Capax Finland Oy (Pulsed Media)  
  - Areas: Repository layout, AGENTS guidelines, ADRs, CI/test flows, storage helpers, benchmarking tooling, and the overall agentic development framework used in this project.

## Authorship Notes

- Designed and assembled by Aleksi Ursin, using agentic workflows and natural-language prompting for code generation, refactoring, and repository-wide consistency under his direction.
- The initial mcxForge codebase, including AGENTS rails and ADR-0001, was created almost entirely through natural-language prompting and agentic tooling rather than traditional file editing.

## Future Contributors

- Additional human contributors should be credited via Git history and pull request metadata.
- Significant architectural changes (for example, new top-level directories, language stacks, or safety model changes) must be captured in new ADRs under `docs/adr/` and should include an `Author:` line naming the primary human author.
